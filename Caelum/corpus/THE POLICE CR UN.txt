  About Us

  Welcome to The Police Credit Union

The Police Credit Union is a full service financial institution offering
solutions that help our members realize their dreams today and plan for
tomorrow. With competitive rates and our attractive REWARDS program, Police
Credit Union members know they are part of a large family. Our staff is always
here to help support you through the process whether it’s applying for a loan,
finding a savings vehicle, or getting your first mortgage.

The philosophy we held dear during our humble beginnings in 1946 was "not for
profit - but for service" and we hold to that commitment today. The mission
and co-operative principles that launched the Credit Union are still the
backbone of plans and objectives today by … taking care of our own.
