  Atlantic Central – About Us

The role of Atlantic Central is to represent and support the credit unions of
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward
Island. Through our leadership and the excellence of our people, products and
services, we support credit unions in becoming the financial institution of
choice.

We are committed to providing professional service to our stakeholders,
including credit unions and their employees, our affiliates and their
employees, and to each other. This professional service includes financial
services and trade association and support services to Atlantic credit unions.

Atlantic Central’s key financial role is management of the system’s liquidity
reserve requirements and provision of central and investment banking services
to Atlantic credit unions. Additional trade association services provided to
credit unions include:

   Risk management 
   Human resources 
   Consulting and support 
   Marketing and communications planning 
   Printing and promotional goods 

With offices in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Riverview, New Brunswick and
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Atlantic Central accepts the roles of
support and leadership defined for us by the credit unions, and with them,
supports the well being of the credit union system and communities it serves.
