Founded on deep historic, social and community roots, the mission of Caisse populaire Desjardins Canadienne Italienne is to provide the Italian community with its own financial institution, while ensuring its long-term success. Aiming for maximum profitability, it must provide considerate, competitive and quality human advisory services. Caisse populaire Desjardins Canadienne Italienne must serve and do business with its members with an Italian touch, in members' own language, while promoting the on-going economic, cultural and social well-being of the community.

Through the Annual General Meeting, your caisse calls on you. It gives you the opportunity to participate in a variety of consultations such as how surplus earnings should be allocated. It also gives you the opportunity to exercise your right to vote to adopt or amend caisse by-laws and elect the directors who sit on the Board of Directors.

The last Annual General Meeting of the Caisse populaire Canadienne Italienne was held on April 15, 2014, and was attended by 200 people. The caisse's balance sheet and financial results were presented to members. The Board of Directors reported to the annual meeting.

The Caisse has a help fund that serves to redistribute a portion of the cooperative's surplus earnings to the community. Following a proposal by the Board of Directors, members decide, during the Annual General Meeting, what portion of the surplus earnings will be paid into the help fund. With the help of their caisse, members can support causes that are important to them.

The members who sit on the Board of Directors manage the help fund. Every year, they report on the fund during the Annual General Meeting.
