Encompass Credit Union was formed April 1, 2015 through the merger of Wainwright Credit Union and Wetaskiwin Credit Union; formed in 1943 and 1939 respectively. A solid financial institution with nearly 12,000 members and over 95 employees serving 8 locations, we ensure our members' financial requirements are taken care of by pairing excellent service with product offerings that meet our members' needs.
We offer competitive rates and tailor products for members and their businesses whenever possible. We have service standards to ensure each member receives preferred treatment and we make every effort to process loans quickly so members have a response when they need it. We understand the needs of rural Albertans and we have trained professionals who conduct on-site visits and will travel to a member's location when necessary. Our head office is in Wainwright, Alberta and we are active in all of our communities.
