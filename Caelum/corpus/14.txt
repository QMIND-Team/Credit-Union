The Full Cupboard
Envision Financial is committed to making a real difference in the financial lives of our members and a meaningful difference in our local communities. That's why we established The Full Cupboard, an innovative community program designed to raise food, funds and awareness for food banks in the communities where Envision Financial operates.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Social responsibility at Envision Financial isn't just a corporate policy—it's a way of life. We believe in the power of partnership, working together to achieve social impact and make a difference in our communities.

Charitable Foundation
In 1996, Envision Financial (then Delta Credit Union) had a vision to create a sustainable source of community funding. To make this dream a reality, the Credit Union established a charitable foundation with an initial donation of $200,000 toward an endowment.

Sponsorship & Donations
We are proud to provide donations, sponsorships and community event funding, use of promotional tents and gifts in kind to a wide variety of groups. We support hospitals, schools, food banks, youth sports teams and sporting events, community centres, festivals, local United Way campaigns and much more.

Scholarships & Bursaries
Each year the Credit Union Foundation of BC provides education awards to credit union members who are British Columbia resident post-secondary students and in need of financial assistance for academic, technological, or vocational training at accredited schools within the province.

Our marquee tents and popcorn machines can help you add a special touch to your fundraising or community event. We have a number of 20 x 20 marquee tents that are perfect for establishing a hub of activity at your next event.
