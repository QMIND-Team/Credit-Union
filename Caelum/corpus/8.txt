A mission to Make Money Make a Difference. A vision to be Alberta’s neighbourhood credit union. A strong foundation of core values that drive everything we do:

WE THINK BIG, ACT LOCAL, TAKE CHARGE, and MAKE BANKING EASY.

Banking is about more than money - it’s a cornerstone of every vibrant community and about positively impacting the communities we live, work and thrive in. We’re your neighbours and partners. We’re built by people who wanted to strengthen their community.

Our members are people, not numbers. They find us in boardrooms, branch offices, volunteering around town, in coffee shops, at kitchen tables, and in farm fields. Everywhere they need us to be.

Wealth, wellness and a bright future are connected. We invest meaningfully in the potential and well-being of our people, and the goals and dreams of our members.

We have honest conversations, about real things, as real people, connecting the dots between financial aspirations and life.

When our members succeed - we succeed. 
THAT’S THE CONNECT FIRST CREDIT UNION DIFFERENCE.
