At Vancity, our vision is to redefine wealth.

Our vision requires us to think differently about wealth—to re-envision prosperity as something we can only achieve if we are surrounded by and connected to a vibrant, healthy community that is sustainable for the long term.

While the traditional banking model focuses on increasing short-term profits for the benefit of shareholders, our vision focuses on meeting the long-term needs of our members and their communities.

Our vision calls on us to measure success in terms of how we contribute to the well-being of our members and their communities—not just financial well-being, but social and environmental well-being as well.

Our goal is to create positive member and community impact through all our operations—from how we make money to how we spend and invest it. We’re committed to finding new and better ways to use all our resources, people and capital to create large-scale positive impacts.

This way of doing business differentiates us from traditional financial institutions. By redefining wealth, we are measuring our success in terms of the health and vitality of the community as a whole.

By holding ourselves to higher standards of innovation, co-operation and accountability, we’re helping to build a wealthier future for all
