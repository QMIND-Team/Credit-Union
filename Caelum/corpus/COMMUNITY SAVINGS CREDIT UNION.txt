  About Community Savings

  For people. Not profit.

  
In 1944, a small group of people, with limited resources but unlimited faith,
pooled their savings to form a credit union that would assist hardworking
people with their financial dreams. Today, Community Savings Credit Union
continues to rely on its founding principles of "people helping people".

Community Savings Credit Union is not restricted to any one group of
individuals. Our doors are  open to anyone  who enjoys personal service and a
wide range of financial products. Societies, partnerships, companies,
proprietorships, and trade unions can also become members of Community Savings
Credit Union.

  Our Vision

To be the credit union of choice within the working community.

  Our Mission

To provide the working community a fair opportunity at a better life, by
empowering them with banking products and investments that are always in their
best interest.

  Guiding Principles

The employees of this credit union are entrusted with the task of financially
empowering British Columbia's working community. As a result, all decisions
regarding rates, products, and services within Community Savings are governed
by four simple principles:

  1. We treat people the way we would want to be treated. 
  2. We only develop products and services that are in our members’ best interest. 
  3. We are on side with union beliefs of fair wage and treatment of workers. 
  4. We support community initiatives that help empower the individual. 

  Strength and Stability

In recent years, Community Savings has been experiencing robust growth. As a
co-operative financial institution, it is now BC’s 16th largest credit union
with assets totaling over $454 million. In addition to the head office, the
credit union has 6 branches located in Metro Vancouver and Victoria. There are
now over 80 employees dedicated to serving our members.
