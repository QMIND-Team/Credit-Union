  Your Credit Union

As a full-service financial institution, Eagle River Credit Union has over
9,475 owners and approximately $156 Million in assets. We understand you
better, because at Eagle River Credit Union, you are an owner, and that means
understanding the best way to serve you is our first priority.

Our complete, attractive package of products and services will allow you to
meet your everyday banking requirements as well as assist you in planning for
your future security. We offer loans, mortgages, chequing and savings,
MasterCard products, registered, non-registered, and market-driven
investments, Internet Banking, business products and services, and much more.
Since 1984, Eagle River Credit Union has grown to offer all the services an
owner requires through innovation and response to owners’ needs.

Becoming an owner is a good investment. It is a better way to handle your
finances because you have a voice. Because you are an owner, understanding you
is important to us. Understanding you means that we are committed to providing
you with the products, services and advice that will help you reach your life
goals. It is a better way because our primary objective is serving you.

Your share requirement is $100 on deposit in your Share account. This $100 is
yours and will stay on deposit with Eagle River Credit Union for as long as
you are an owner.

Choose a financial institution where the very ownership structure is designed
to serve your needs in the best way and where there is a real commitment to
providing you with the skills and information you need to help you realize
your financial goals.
