It means we're focused on growing prosperity in southwestern Ontario, investing 100% of profits back into the people, businesses and communities we serve.

It means we have a purpose beyond profit, thinking differently about how we conduct our business and making decisions that have a positive impact on our customer-Owners, our communities and our staff.

We call this our Prosperity Purpose, and we integrate it into everything we do. And, by doing business with Libro, you’re part of that larger purpose too!
