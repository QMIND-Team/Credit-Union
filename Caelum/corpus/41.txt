Mission Statement

"Prairie Centre, 1st choice financial solutions for our community"

Our Values at Work

Leading by values is empowering. At PCCU, we bring these values to life in our policies, procedures, and in our day-to-day operations. At Prairie Centre, we value:

Member Satisfaction
Productive and Satisfied Staff
Rural Base
Financial Strength and Sustainability
Cooperative Principles
Vision, Leadership & Innovation
Integrity
Communication
Social Responsibility
Member Involvement

Prairie Centre lives where you live and supports the communities we serve. We are a member-owned financial institution and it's our responsibility to give back to the communities we serve. Our corporate support priorities include education, youth, health, arts, culture, sports, and recreation.

On average, PCCU invests over $100,000 annually which is made up of cash and in-kind contributions. This doesn't include the generous volunteer hours our staff contribute every year. Whenever there is a community event or initiative taking place, you likely won't have to look very far to find a PCCU staff member volunteering!
