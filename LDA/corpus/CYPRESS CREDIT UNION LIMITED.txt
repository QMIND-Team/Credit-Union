  A Brief History Of Cypress Credit Union Limited

Cypress Credit Union Limited was formed in December 1945 and was originally
known as Maple Creek Savings and Credit Union Limited. In 1967 Golden Prairie
Savings and Credit Union amalgamated with Maple Creek Savings and Credit Union
Limited. A branch was opened in Consul, Saskatchewan in 1973. The name Cypress
Credit Union was born in 1994 after an amalgamation with Tompkins Credit
Union. On January 1, 2001, Richmound Savings and Credit Union amalgamated with
Cypress to become a branch. In 2005 Cypress Credit Union celebrated 60 years
of incorporation. In January of 2007, Fox Valley Credit Union amalgamated with
us and in January of 2014 we once again expanded our network with the
amalgamation of the Mendham-Burstall branch.

Cypress Credit Union Limited currently has a membership of 4,270 members and
an asset base of approximately 198 million dollars. Our Board of Directors,
Management and Staff are progressive, and committed to providing quality
financial services to the communities that we serve.
