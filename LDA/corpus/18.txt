Caisse Financial Group is a bilingual financial institution offering financial products and services for every phase of life.
Caisse Financial Group was the first officially registered financial co-operative in Manitoba, established in St. Malo, Manitoba, in 1937 with 29 members and $96.85 in assets.

Today, we have evolved to a full-service, billion dollar financial institution with 19 branch locations in Manitoba and over 35,000 members.

Our mission is:
To be open to all
To offer personalized service in French and English
To support the financial health of our members
To develop enduring relationships with our members, employees and communities
We have come a long way but our values have remained the same. Every member counts.
