Ever thought about becoming a Member and an Owner?
More than 118,000 Ontarians choose FirstOntario for their financial needs – from chequing and savings accounts to loans and mortgages and highly qualified investment advice. Our Membership does more than save you money on fees. It also makes you an Owner.

We provide you all of the services, safety and security of a major financial institution but with one big difference: we operate on a cooperative model so we can put you first, and see you as a person not a credit score.

We provide these services through 32 locations in 14 communities across Ontario, including Hamilton, Halton, Niagara, Norfolk, and Oxford. Plus, you’ll have world-wide free ATM accessibility, access to online, mobile and telephone account services, credit card convenience – everything you need to handle your money economically and efficiently. The FirstOntario Business Centre in downtown Hamilton offers a full suite of banking products and services designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses.
