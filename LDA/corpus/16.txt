As far as credit unions in Manitoba go, Assiniboine Credit Union is right up there among the largest. Our financial and banking capabilities are demonstrated by our robust membership base, the health of our assets and our 18 branches from Winnipeg to Gillam and Thompson. But don't just take our word for it; talk to our members, and the communities we support. We're proud (and rather humbled) that we've been able to help to make a difference in the lives of thousands of Manitobans.
Money doing more. This simple thought holds a bigger truth. It represents the way we do business, our promise to our members and our commitment to the communities we live and work in. The co-operative values that guide us ensure we remain financially sound while being socially, environmentally and ethically responsible.
Assiniboine Credit Union meets or exceeds all privacy standards established by industry guidelines, provincial legislation, the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and all other applicable laws. Find out more, here.
