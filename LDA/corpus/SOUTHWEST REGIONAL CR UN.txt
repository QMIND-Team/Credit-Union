  About Us

  Banking Like it Used to Be

We have come a long way since 1939 and much has changed – but the Credit Union
still believes in its roots of ‘Serving People with People’ and is focused on
providing superior service to its membership. Our history shows just how much
we have grown, but our future is always focused on providing “Banking Like it
Used to Be.”
