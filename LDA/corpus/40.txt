Integris Credit Union was established in 2005 after the Nechako Valley Credit Union, the Prince George Savings Credit Union and the Quesnel and District Credit Union amalgamation. Since then, we have become the financial heart of Northern British Columbia passionately serving our members.

At Integris, we have integrated ourselves as a staple in the communities that we serve. These communities include Clinton, Fort St. James, Prince George, Quesnel and Vanderhoof. We have over 25,000 members in our five communities.

Our business has developed a reputation for always going above and beyond for our members. Integris is a financial institution that cares about its members, staff and communities.

This can be seen through many different recognitions, such as:

Service Excellence (Chamber of Commerce, 2009 & 2013)
Employer Excellence (BC Business Magazine, 2009)
Community Engagement (Chamber of Commerce, 2011)
Corporate Citizenship (Chamber of Commerce, 2012)
Business of the Year (Chamber of Commerce, 2013)

Whether your needs are individual or business oriented we have what you need. We are the financial heart of our communities offering banking, insurance, financial planning and group benefits for individual and business alike.

We’re A Financial Co-operative
You’re a what? As a Credit Union, we’re a financial co-operative. This means that not only are we owned and operated by our members, we’re also dedicated to creating lasting relationships with credit unions on a provincial, national and international level. This is done by following the 7 Co-operative Principles.

At Integris, we don’t just talk about being a co-operative: we act, participate and inspire, in hopes of helping others in their journey to becoming a better financial institution and a better co-operative. For more about a co-operative click here.
