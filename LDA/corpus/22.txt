Fusion is the result of the official amalgamation of Catalyst and Vanguard Credit Unions on April 1, 2018.

Today, we are a full-service financial institution serving almost 30,000 members across 18 branches in the Parkland and South Western Manitoba.

With assets under administration exceeding $1.06 billion, Fusion has the capacity, the commitment and the unique opportunity to support prosperity and growth in our home communities like no one else can.

Collectively, we believe the future of our communities lies in our shared ability to be creative, to aspire to new things, to create and embrace new economic opportunities, while remaining grounded in our values.

Individually, people who are financially confident have more freedom to live their lives on their own terms. So we actively support our members to achieve and increase their financial confidence through financial literacy programs in schools, in branches, and online. We offer fraud prevention and financial safety information. And we provide a full line of consultation and wealth management services to help our members make informed decisions about the best course of action for today and into the future.

At Fusion, we keep the success and wellness of our members and our communities in the forefront of all our decisions, at all levels. We see this as the basis of our success as well.
