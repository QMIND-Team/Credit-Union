  Our Story, Vision, Mission

We’ve been described as a ‘glass half full’ kind of credit union. Maybe it’s
because we look for opportunity in a changing market, rather than being
discouraged. Or maybe it’s because we love our communities and feel truly
fortunate to serve them. Or because helping our members achieve their goals
makes our team do a happy dance. All we can tell you for sure is that at
Accent Credit Union, we see ourselves as a family. We stick together. And we
make great things happen. If that’s glass half-full, we’ll take it.

  The Accent Credit Union Story

We officially became ‘Accent Credit Union’ in 2010, after a most fortunate
merger of Quill Lake and Kelvington Credit Unions. Before we even opened our
doors, our team agreed that we would put the accent on service in every member
interaction, community event and strategic decision we had or made. We’re
happy to say that it’s working.

Our members are happy, our staff is thriving, we’ve already exceeded our
initial goals and our future looks extremely bright. We’re guided by an
unwavering commitment to meet the personal and business banking, investment,
insurance and planning needs of our members. And we keep our profits in our
communities, right where they belong.

  What we stand for

It’s in our branches, here on our website and in the hearts and minds of every
one of our staff members. This is what we stand for, every day, for every
member:

Vision Statement  
Accent Credit Union is more than our name. It’s our commitment. We put the
accent on service.

Mission Statement  
Accent Credit Union is dedicated to providing the right product and the right
service at the right time.
