We partner with credit unions to ensure their 5 million plus members across
Canada can choose competitive financial services from their local credit
union.

Concentra's suite of business solutions specialize in asset management,
treasury needs, and trust solutions focusing on providing credit unions with
effective strategies to improve financial performance, manage risk, and grow
relationships with their members.

Concentra brings national connections to local credit unions, delivering
expertise and financial clout to strengthen the credit union system.

Concentra continues to evolve as a dynamic wholesale bank within Canada's
financial services industry. In fact, through  continuance  under the  Bank
Act  on January 1, 2017, Concentra became the first schedule one chartered
bank focused on providing financial services to Canada's credit union system.

With deep roots in the co-operative system,  Concentra's Story  is built on
shared values and our commitment to success through serving credit unions from
coast to coast.
