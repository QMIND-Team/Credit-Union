  About Us

  Actually, "About Us" is about you.

Our customers are our members, our members are our owners, and our success
begins and ends with you.

Its our job to be there with the right financial support so you can make the
most of opportunity, whenever and wherever it appears. Thats local money for
better lives.

Its also our job to give back in your community. An account with us supports
a neighbours mortgage, a loan to a business down the street, insurance for a
nearby familys future, bursaries for children at a school near you, a
sponsorship, a community centre, and many more local causes, events and
programs. Thats local money for local good.

And you have a job too. Its to weigh in, speak up, and vote for what matters
to you. When youre a member of a credit union, youre also an owner. You help
set priorities and choose our direction. You help create the Interior Savings
Credit Union that makes us all proud.

Its about all of us, together   and all the good we can do, for each other,
right here. Thats the power of local money.
