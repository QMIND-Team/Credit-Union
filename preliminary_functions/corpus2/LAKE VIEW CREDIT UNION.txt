  Over 70 Years Experience

Lake View Credit Unions history of member service began in the years after
the great depression. Born in Dawson Creek on August 1943 with 12 members and
$6, in September 1944, the credit union had 141 members and a share capital of
$25,820. LVCU had the distinction of being one of the fastest growing credit
unions in British Columbia, and today we proudly service over 10,500 members
with assets over $310 million.

In 1974, LVCU expanded its services by opening a branch in Chetwynd, B.C., and
in 2001 it became the only financial institution in Tumbler Ridge, B.C. Today,
Lake View Credit Union continues to serve our members, led by the vision and
direction of our Board of Directors.
