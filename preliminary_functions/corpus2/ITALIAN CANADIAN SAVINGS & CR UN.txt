   What's New 
Cooperative banking is at the core of what we do, and what weve always done
since we opened our doors in Woodbridge in 2000. With roots in the Italian-
Canadian community, IC Savings has grown into one of Ontarios most trusted
and well-established credit unions since then; one that is here to help
people, like you, achieve financial independence.

We currently serve some 13,000 members, whether in-branch, online or by
mobile, and through our lending division in the Greater Toronto Area and
throughout southwestern Ontario. Our members benefit from a full suite of
financial products, suiting every stage of their life, expert advice and
friendly service that puts them at the centre of everything we do.

  Welcome to banking with a higher purpose

At IC Savings we also believe that our profits should have a higher purpose.
Yes, they should be returned to our members in the form of great rates and
services. We also think that they should be invested in the communities where
we all live to do good. Were proud to make real and lasting impacts through
the activities of our credit union and our foundation, which was established
in 2009.  Click here  to learn a little more.
