  About Us

Over the last 68 years, Vision Credit Union has evolved from one branch in
Camrose with assets of $178, serving 21 members, to eleven branches serving
the Battle River region, with over 17,000 members, and $579 million in assets.
On May 1, 2014, we officially merged with Caisse Horizon Credit Union, adding
another six branches in Northern Alberta, and increasing our assets to over $1
billion, serving approximately 23,000 members. We changed our name to Vision
Credit Union Ltd.

Vision Credit Union has grown with its members, and helps communities to grow
and prosper as well. Our goal is to help you achieve your financial goals. We
work hard every day to bring you quality products and services, innovative
technology, commitment to community, and service with a smile!

  How profit share works...

As a member-owner in 2018, your share of the profit was 25.0% back for every
dollar of loan interest you paid in the last year. You were also paid an
additional 25.0% for every dollar in interest income you received in the last
year.

For example, if you had a $100,000 mortgage at 4% at Vision Credit Union,
total loan interest in the 12-month fiscal year would be $4,000. This profit
share payout at 25.0% means $1,000 would have been added to your common share
account.

If you earned deposit interest during the year, you also benefitted with this
payout. As an example, let's assume you earned $1,800 in interest during the
year. Your common share account would grow by 25.0% of $1,800 - your reward
would have been $450.

If you want to find out how you can join and then share in the profits of your
credit union, stop by your local branch.
