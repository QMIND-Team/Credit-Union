   Why Choose Stride Credit Union? 

  About Us

Stride Credit Union  was founded January 1  st  , 2017 after a successful
amalgamation between Austin Credit Union and Portage Credit Union. Intentions
to amalgamate were announced at each credit union's annual general meeting in
April of 2016. Members of each credit union then voted on the proposal to
amalgamate in June, 2016; results were overwhelmingy in favour of the
amalgamation with a fantastic positive response.  
  
Today, Stride Credit Union is a co-operative financial institution, operating
in the best interests of our members and our communities. Because we are
locally owned and operated by members and the communities in which we serve,
our decision making is based on the best interest of our members. With each
member having one SHARE and one VOTE and a Board of Directors elected from the
membership, we can react to the wishes and needs of our members quickly and
efficiently.  
  
Stride Credit Union operates eight branches across six communities in the
Central Plains region; Austin, Gladstone, MacGregor, Oakville, Plumas and
Portage la Prairie. We offer a complete line of financial products and
services for any and every kind of member, from personal (new and experienced)
to business owners and the farming community. Our primary objective is to
provide friendly, personalized, professional financial services and fair
pricing to our members at all times.
