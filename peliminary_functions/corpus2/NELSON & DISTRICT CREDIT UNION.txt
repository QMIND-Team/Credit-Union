  About Us

At Nelson & District Credit Union our mission is Enriching lives locally.

At NDCU, we have a long history. From cash box to community cornerstone,
Nelson, Rossland and the East Shore locations have been the local credit
unions for decades. Based on a history as an alternative to the banks, NDCU
has grown from a modest beginning to an innovative, community-based financial
co-operative. We believe the key to our success has been our membership.

Thank you.
