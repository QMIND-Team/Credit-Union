About Us  |

  About Us

Cambrian Credit Union was established in 1959. Since then, we have grown to be
one of the largest credit unions serving the Winnipeg and Selkirk
marketplaces. With more than $3.6 billion in assets and over 63,000 members,
we strive to help each of our members build strong financial foundations for
making their dreams come true. This is not only our mission, but our core
purpose.  

  

  What is a credit union?

Simply put a credit union is a co-operative owned and controlled by its
members. Each member of a credit union must purchase a share in order to gain
membership.

  

  Core Values

Everything we do at Cambrian is guided by our five simple values:  Integrity
and honesty;  Member Focused;  Competitive;  Community Involvement;
Innovative Spirit.  These simple values ensure that each of our members is
guaranteed to receive hassle-free banking day in and day out.
