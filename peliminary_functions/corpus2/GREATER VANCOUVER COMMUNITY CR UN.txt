  About Us

GVC Credit Union is proud to be one of the oldest credit unions in British
Columbia. We serve approximately 6000 members from 4 branches in the lower
mainland and strive to provide our members with excellent, personalized member
service.

  Who We Are

GVC Credit Union was one of the first credit union study clubs organized in BC
during the 1930's and was part of a program to help people find ways to combat
the ravages of the economic depression that hit in 1929. On June 5, 1940, GVC
Credit Union received its charter and commenced operations.

  Board and Elections

The Board of Directors, elected by and accountable to our membership, governs
GVC Credit Union. By focusing on the best interests of the credit union, they
are committed to the achievement of our goals and objectives.

  Member Benefits

At GVC Credit Union, you are not just a customer; you are a member-owner and a
shareholder. And membership with a credit union means so much more!

  Credit Union Advantage

Credit Unions have been serving Canadians since 1900 and today are trusted by
millions across the country.
