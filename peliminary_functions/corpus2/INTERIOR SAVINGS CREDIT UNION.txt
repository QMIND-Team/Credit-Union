  About Us

  Actually, "About Us" is about you.

Our customers are our members, our members are our owners, and our success
begins and ends with you.

It’s our job to be there with the right financial support so you can make the
most of opportunity, whenever and wherever it appears. That’s local money for
better lives.

It’s also our job to give back in your community. An account with us supports
a neighbour’s mortgage, a loan to a business down the street, insurance for a
nearby family’s future, bursaries for children at a school near you, a
sponsorship, a community centre, and many more local causes, events and
programs. That’s local money for local good.

And you have a job too. It’s to weigh in, speak up, and vote for what matters
to you. When you’re a member of a credit union, you’re also an owner. You help
set priorities and choose our direction. You help create the Interior Savings
Credit Union that makes us all proud.

It’s about all of us, together  … and all the good we can do, for each other,
right here. That’s the power of local money.
