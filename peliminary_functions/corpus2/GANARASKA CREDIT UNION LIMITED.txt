  About Us

Ganaraska Financial Credit Union is an organization dedicated to serving its
members in various communities. Our organization provides a combination of the
highest quality banking services without the typical banking experience. We
know your names and faces and we know what your communities need because we
are members of your community.

At GFCU we aren`t just a financial institution. Of course we offer all of the
products and services you`d come to expect from any of the Big Banks or other
Credit Unions, but we do it with your best interest in mind. We have great
Mortgage Specialists who are eager to get you into a home. We offer exciting
products such as our cashable terms that can`t be found anywhere else in the
market place. With every decision we make, we have our members interest in
mind such as our absolutely free banking on demand including mobile banking
and E-Money Transfer. We offer absolute free chequing through our member share
offer because we don`t believe our members should have to pay service fees.
We`ll never charge you to deposit money because this is your Credit Union.

We take an active part in our communities and with every step we take, we look
outside of our walls and to communities we take pride in helping to grow
stronger. As we move forward, we`ll move forward together and do all we can to
make our members day to day lives easier.
