  About Us

  Welcome to Comtech Fire Credit Union

We are a full service financial institution that offers outstanding benefits
to our members and their families. With over $530 million in overall assets
and more than 20,000 members across Ontario, our organization has been growing
strong for over 75 years. Unlike a bank, our members share in the ownership of
our organization, which means they have a say in how we operate.

After reserve requirements are met, profits are returned to the membership in
the form of lower interest rates on loans and mortgages and higher rates of
return on deposit investments.

Our Credit Union is committed to providing you with financial advice and
products in a personalized relationship driven environment. We are small
enough to know our members by name and large enough to provide the financial
resources comparable to larger financial institutions. Our history and
experience in the communication and technology sectors have provided us with a
strong and loyal membership base and we are considered an employee benefit for
many leading companies in this industry.

Honesty & Integrity

   Honesty and Integrity guide everything we do. 
   We earn and maintain the trust of our members, employees, communities and business partners throughout every interaction.

Respect

   We value and respect diversity of background, religion, lifestyle and thought. 

Energetic, Dynamic & Motivated

   We are never satisfied with the status quo and strive to continually improve our company and ourselves. 
   We communicate openly and embrace member interaction. 
   We continuously drive member intimacy to innovate our products and services. 

Innovative & Entrepreneurial

   We are committed to excellence and the achievement of long-lasting relationships through our members' life cycles. 
   We aim high and hold ourselves to those standards. 
   We look to find creative solutions to fulfill expectations of our members, employees, communities and business partners. 
   We will celebrate our successes and learn from our failures.
