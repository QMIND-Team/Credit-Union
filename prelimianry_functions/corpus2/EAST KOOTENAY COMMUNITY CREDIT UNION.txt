  In Our Community

Since 1950, East Kootenay Community Credit Union has helped our communities
grow by understanding our East Kootenay economy and our passion for lifestyle.
We are a financial institution, with a financial planning and insurance
division, committed to making the communities we serve better places to live.
This commitment goes beyond the volunteer efforts of staff and the worthwhile
endeavors we support in our communities. In fact, we take pride in
demonstrating to our members that the same kind of caring and dedication that
goes into what we do in the community also takes place at the branch level and
is at the very heart of our relationship with the members we serve.

Last year, staff, management and the board of directors donated numerous
volunteer hours, and EKC contributions to community initiatives totalled over
$100,000.
