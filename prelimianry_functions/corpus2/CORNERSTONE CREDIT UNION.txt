  About Us

  Together we'll do great things

That's been our motto for over 75 years, and we are sticking to it!!  
  
Cornerstone Credit Union was founded by a small group of people dedicated to
pulling together to help each other. We've stuck to that philosophy - to this
day our members are our pride and our priority.  
  
We are more than 24,000 members strong and have nine branches across east
central Saskatchewan.

  What We Stand For

As more financial institutions offer the same products, service becomes more
important than ever.  
We have genuine, knowledgeable staff to help you with your financial goals.
Our members always come first - we're about relationships not transactions.
