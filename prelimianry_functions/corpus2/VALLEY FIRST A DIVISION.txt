  Our History

  Valley First, a division of First West Credit Union, has a rich history.
From humble beginnings more than 65 years ago, Valley First has grown into a
strong, innovative and vibrant organization with a branch network spanning the
Okanagan, Similkameen and Thompson valleys.

&nbsp

  Valley First Through the Years

Beginnings  
The Knights of Pythias Lodge 49, the Penticton branch of a North American
fraternal organization, formed B.C.s 166th credit union on Feb. 7, 1947. By
years end it had been re-named the Penticton and District Credit Union,
offered its 51 members loans and shares and had total assets of $938.26.

1950s  
The Penticton and District Credit Union continued to grow. By 1956, the
organizations assets totaled $171,636. In 1959 the credit union moved to
leased quarters at 184 Main Street in Penticton, the same location it occupies
today.

1960s  
As it approached its 20th anniversary, assets surpassed $800,000 and the
credit union bought the property it was leasing at 184 Main Street.

1970s  
The credit union amalgamated with Keremeos Credit Union in 1970 and by the
time Pentictons Skaha branch opened in 1977, the organization had nine
employees and had made the change to computerized transactions.

1980s  
The credit union grew by buying Yale District Credit Unions Princeton branch
in 1982, opening an Oliver branch in 1984 and changing its name to Valley
First Credit Union in 1983 to reflect its wider service area. By its 40th
anniversary in 1987, Valley First had more than 15,000 members and in 1989
made its largest donation ever to the regional hospital.

1990s  
Valley First entered new territory, opening Kelownas Downtown, Guisachan
Village and Orchard Plaza branches in 1992 and 1993, as well as branches in
Vernon and Pentictons Cherry Lane mall. The credit union formed Baron
Insurance (later renamed Valley First Insurance Services) after acquiring a
number of Capri Insurance locations and the Baron Insurance Group in 1994.
Membership soared, reaching 26,000 by Valley Firsts 50th anniversary.

2000s  
Valley First continued to grow, amalgamating with the Armstrong Spallumcheen
Savings and Credit Union and buying the KCP Credit Union in Kamloops in 2001.
In 2007, as it celebrated 60 years of service, Valley First saw membership
surpass 45,000 and total assets reach more than $1 billion. On Jan. 1, 2010,
Valley First, which by then had become the eighth largest credit union in
B.C., merged with Langley-based Envision Financial to form First West Credit
Union. Unlike a traditional merger, Valley First and Envision Financial agreed
to continue operating under separate brands in their respective service
regions, while sharing corporate services. Enderby & District Credit Union
joined First West in 2013, and Island Savings joined in 2015.

Today, First West Credit Union is B.C.'s third-largest credit union and is led
by CEO Launi Skinner.  Learn more about Launi  and  First West  .

The Valley First division is led by  Paulo Araujo  and operates 16 branches
and 11 insurance offices.
